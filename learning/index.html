  <h1> Sam Learns HTML </h1>
  <p>
  Here I'm exploring different HTML tags. Currently I'm used to markdown, which is far simpler than HTML markup. Hopefully, however, HTML markup will also be more powerful! And <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 3</a> is autocompleting my tags beautifully. </p> <br>
  <p>
  Let's check out <b>some bold text</b>, and some <i> italicized text</i>! <br>
  Does starting a new line without a &lt;br&gt; tag still start a new line? I'm also using "entity names" here to attempt to "escape" the tags.
  </p>
  <p> Okay, I've updated to include &lt;br&gt; and &lt;p&gt;tags, let's see if that works. It looks like &lt;p&gt; creates a paragraph with whitespace at the end, whereas &lt;br&gt; ONLY inserts a linebreak, which maintains the same paragraph.</p>
  <br>
  <big>BIG text!</big> <br>
  <small>small text</small><br>
  <strong>STRONG text.</strong> <b>B text.</b> Is &lt;strong&gt; 
  different from &lt;br&gt; somehow? <br>
