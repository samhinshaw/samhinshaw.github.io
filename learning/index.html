  <h1> Sam Learns HTML </h1>
  Here I'm exploring different HTML tags. Currently I'm used to markdown, which is far simpler than HTML markup. Hopefully, however, HTML markup will also be more powerful! And <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 3</a> is autocompleting my tags beautifully. 

  Let's check out <b>some bold text</b>, and some <i> italicized text</i>!
  Does starting a new line without a &lt;br&gt; tag still start a new line? I'm also using "entity names" here to attempt to "escape" the tags.
